## Preparations
1, You should create a directory named `datasets` to store the training and test data. (Here I use 300W_LP for training and AFLW2000 for testing)  
2, You should create a directory named `outputs` with two subdirectories `images` for storing the predicted iamges and `sanpshots` for archives.
